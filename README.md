This application was started in 2016 by a group passionate about the outdoors. It was intended to be a website where users could view and share experiences, see what activities different locations had to offer, and rent/buy equipment or be directed to a site that would let them do so. The project was abandoned after only a couple of months due to the group losing interest and no financial support. 

The application is not finished, in fact it is barely even a prototype. However, to see what the final product might have looked like, you can click on the snowboarding icon from index.html and look at the locations page as well as the manitou springs page.

All development of the actual application was done by Zachary Todd. 



###########This application was made using HTML5 Boilerplate###########
